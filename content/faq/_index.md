## Introduction 

In command-line examples on this page, commands to be typed to the shell begin with a dollar sign “$”. Lines that do not begin with “$” show command output.

The text uses you@example.com as a stand-in for your user name. If you run one of these commands, substitute your own name for that one.

```bash
$ run this
```

The examples are Unix-oriented but it should be easy to adapt them to a Windows environment.


## What is de0gee?

We designed de0gee as a small and inconspicuous helper for the professional developers and designers. Why an emphasis on “professional”? Well, because de0gee is neither a kit of ready elements nor a set of templates; de0gee is mainly a tool, which helps to keep routine tasks to a minimum. de0gee doesn’t impose its own styles and doesn’t require following any specific design rules or practices. It makes de0gee ideal for creative and challenging tasks of making unique websites with the unique design. For those who know HTML/CSS/JS inside out, de0gee may become an irreplaceable tool that saves countless hours of work.

```json
{
    "test":-20
}
```

If you are new to HTML/CSS/JS, then you may have a hard time implementing de0gee in your projects, and it may just not be a tool for you yet. But certainly feel free to download and explore de0gee, and see where this journey will take you!

## What are the goals of the project?

With over 15 years of web development experience under the belt, we can assure you that Nav Bars and all other sorts of navigational elements are always faster and easier to build for a project from scratch than to modify, customize and rebuild an existing solution.

Each and every project has its unique navigational needs and often requires more of a custom approach. Vast experience shows that writing code for navigation from ground up is less time-consuming and more efficient, than tweaking and creating the navigation based on a boilerplate solution.

## Can I use de0gee on my phone?

Nope. We want to keep de0gee minimalistic, small and flexible. So, actually, there’s more chance of us removing stuff from the code and functions while preserving features, than adding new code and new stuff.

## Can I access de0gee from a web browser?

Right now, de0gee is a self-sufficient, modern and complete product. We have no specific plans of adding any new components anytime soon; we do not plan to extend de0gee as well. Our goal is to improve the things that make de0gee so awesome by squashing bugs, refactoring the code and improving overall performance.

Having this said, we are keeping our eyes on what’s new in the world of HTML, CSS, and JS, and if something truly exciting happens in future with these technologies (comparable, let’s say, to flexbox emergence), we most certainly will consider these changes and will be first to go ahead and implement them as soon as possible.

## How do de0gee servers authenticate users?

Old versions of de0gee are critically outdated, and we strongly encourage you to stop using them as soon as you can. We do not offer old versions for download, and we do not provide old documentation. We realize that this may be an inconvenience, however, we also deeply believe that upgrading to the new de0gee will bring way greater positive effect to your projects than the ability to support legacy versions.

## Are my files encrypted?

Basically, you take the new de0gee and start afresh from scratch. The old de0gee had been built on a completely different set of principles and technologies, and it is pretty much incompatible with the new de0gee in every way. Starting anew with the new de0gee will also give you an opportunity to reevaluate your project in a new light and improve it in general.

## Can I create design themes for sale based on de0gee?

You absolutely can! You have our permission to use de0gee in whatever projects you wish commercial, for sale, or otherwise, in whichever way you like.
