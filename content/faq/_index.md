## Introduction 

In command-line examples on this page, commands to be typed to the shell begin with a dollar sign “$”. Lines that do not begin with “$” show command output.

The text uses you@example.com as a stand-in for your user name. If you run one of these commands, substitute your own name for that one.

```bash
$ run this
```

The examples are Unix-oriented but it should be easy to adapt them to a Windows environment.
