<p>Kube has been designed to help you with web development, that's why it's so easy to use Kube when building websites. To move forward quickly and efficiently, just link <code>kube.scss</code> from Kube package: this file contains variables, mixins and everything you need to simplify daily routine tasks.
</p>

<p>
    For example, import kube.scss into your master.scss styles file, which you will later compile into <code>master.css</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="hljs-comment">// master.scss</span>
@<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> <span class="hljs-string">"dist/scss/kube.scss"</span>;</pre>

<p>
    Now all Kube's variables and mixins are readily available in <code>master.scss</code>,
    and you can use them whenever needed. For instance, here's how one of examples:
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="hljs-comment">// master.scss</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">@import</span> <span class="hljs-string">"dist/scss/kube.scss"</span>;

<span class="hljs-selector-id">#sidebar</span> {
    <span class="hljs-variable">@include</span> flex-item-width(<span class="hljs-number">200px</span>);
}</pre>

<p>Also, you could use settings from <code>variables.scss</code>:</p>


<pre class="code"><span class="hljs-comment">// master.scss</span>
@<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> <span class="hljs-string">"dist/scss/kube.scss"</span>;

<span class="hljs-selector-id">#my-layout</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">padding</span>: <span class="hljs-variable">$base-line</span>;
}</pre>
